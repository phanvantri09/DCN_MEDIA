                                        <p>During your life you will probably meet some people who seem like they may be the
                                            one, or that they are close, but still have the feeling that something else is
                                            missing. My advice is that if you are not happy, because something seems like it
                                            is missing, then it usually is not right.</p>

                                        <p>Before I found my special someone, I was in a relationship for over 10 years, and
                                            I thought everything was great, until I started to seriously consider getting
                                            married. Then I noticed that we had so little in common and in reality wanted so
                                            many different things out of life and one day we both realized there was much
                                            about each of us that we both wanted from someone, but it was not us that we
                                            wanted.</p>

                                            or they seemed great after talking to them for 5 minutes but they seemed to have
